Building packages:
----
* SLACKWARE:

Require pysetuptools (is not installed for 14.1 and previous version   
of Slackware:)   
[slackbuild.org](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/python/pysetuptools/)

Then, download my SlackBuild for compile the binary package:   
[jeanslack slackbuilds](https://github.com/jeanslack/slackbuilds/tree/master/cliffwall)   

See the INSTALL file for more details and info on how-to build a 
Slackware package

* DEBIAN:

- Install stdeb and distutils whit apt:

     # apt-get install python-all python-stdeb fakeroot

- Download the latest version of cliffwall at:

    <https://github.com/jeanslack/cliffwall/releases>
  
  ..and unzip the archive
  
  Or if you prefer clone with git:
     
     git clone https://github.com/jeanslack/cliffwall

	 USAGE for generate both source and binary packages (.deb)
	       Enter in unzipped sources folder and type (with not root):
			
		   python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
		 
	 USAGE for generate source packages only. 
	       Enter in unzipped sources folder and type (with not root):
		   
		   python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command sdist_dsc
            
	 RESOURCES:
	 - look at there for major info:
		 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb
		 http://shallowsky.com/blog/programming/python-debian-packages-w-stdeb.html

This should create a python-myApplication_version_all.deb in the new deb_dist directory.

Known Issues:
----

- On Debian 9 stretch, the python-cliffwall.postinstall file is not executed at 
  the post installation of the debian package. This happens if you compile the 
  cliffwall source with the above commands. To fix this problem,You should 
  complete the configuration manually, then type:
  
             # systemctl enable cliffwall-init
             
  This make a links to run level start-up (rcN.d). The reasons are explained 
  in the changelog file
