FOR DEBIAN USERS ONLY:
 
Come see, this folder has a underscore that precedes the debian name.
Without this underscore should be considered when compiling the debian 
binary package with distutils/stdeb, but this implementation for now seems 
to work only on Debian 7 wheezy. :-(

If you take this into, you might want to remove the underscore for that 
version of Debian where it work, or try to solve this problem for the 
others versions.

This folder, however, contains an debian .postinst file that would run at the 
end of the package installation. It checks the Debian version release to invoke 
the most start-up service manager to update symbolic links in /etc/rcN.d .
By doing this, you would avoid doing it manually after installation.

Other explanations:
------------------
 
On Debian 9 stretch my /debian/python-cliffwall.postinst is not has used by 
stdeb and then is not executed at the post installation of the debian package. 
This happens if you compile the cliffwall source with distutils and stdeb.
For now, I have removed the only possibility of using the postinst file and 
avoid this problem.
To fix this problem you should do it manually after installation:

		   # systemctl enable cliffwall-init
		   
This make a links to run level start-up (rcN.d).
