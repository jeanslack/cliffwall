- On Debian 9 stretch my /debian/python-cliffwall.postinst is not has used by 
  stdeb and then is not executed at the post installation of the debian package. 
  This happens if you compile the cliffwall source with distutils and stdeb.
  For now, I have removed the only possibility of using the postinst file 
  and avoid this problem.
  To fix this problem you should do it manually after installation:

- Fix error to a path string in the 'cliffwall-init-functions' file. 
  This string regard the 'cliffwall block' command that not was match 
  with the file name:
  /etc/cliffwall/block_network > /etc/cliffwall/block
  
- File and folder placement is now completely relegated to setup.py
