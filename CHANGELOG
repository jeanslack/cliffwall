- Fix error to a path string in the 'cliffwall-init-functions' file. 
  This string regard the 'cliffwall block' command that not was match 
  with the file name:
  /etc/cliffwall/block_network > /etc/cliffwall/block
  
- I seem to have solving a problem of the python-cliffwall.postinst script
  during binary debian packages installation, on a linking run level start up. 
  From Debian 8 jessy systemd is a replacement for sysvinit, so it is necessary 
  to evaluate which system is in use. This would make the .deb package 
  back-compatible with Debian wheezy, Debian jessie to Debian stretch.
  
- File and folder placement is now completely relegated to setup.py
